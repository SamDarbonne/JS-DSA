### BinaryTree
high performance AVL self-balancing binary search tree. Ensures optimal insertion and removal through dynamically adjusting node positions in the tree through self-rotations. Suitable for applications where consistent, fast removal is key. Uses an optional callback function to determine sorting priority. 

### PriorityQueues, MinPriorityQueue and MaxPriorityQueue
Built using the BinaryTree class to efficiently manage the queue. Ensures fast removal and dynamic reordering through an optional callback function that maintains priority order. Suitable for applications requiring consistent, priority-based task handling. Includes both MinPriorityQueue and MaxPriorityQueue variations to suit different priority strategies.
